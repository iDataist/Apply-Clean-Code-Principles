# Predict Customer Churn

## Project Description
In this project, I applied the clean code principles (modular, documented, and tested) to implement a classifier that predicts customer churn. 

## Project Steps
- To automatically generate the `requirements.txt` file, type `pipreqs --force` in cli.
- To install the required python packages, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in cli.
- To lint a python script, type `black --line-length 79 PATH_TO_FILE` and `flake8 PATH_TO_FILE` in cli.
- To run the machine learning pipeline, type `python churn_library.py` in cli.
- To run the tests, type `python test_churn_library.py` in cli.
- To view the logs, type `cat logs/churn_library.log`
